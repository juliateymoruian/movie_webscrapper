The necessary libraries to run the code are located in the environment folder. However, all of the libraries should be included in Anaconda. In the event your Anaconda does not have these packages I will list them below.

conda install pandas
conda install matplotlib
conda instal ipython
conda install ipywidgets
conda install plotly
conda install wordcloud

Please enjoy the project and if there are any questions or concerns please email me at teymouri@usc.edu
